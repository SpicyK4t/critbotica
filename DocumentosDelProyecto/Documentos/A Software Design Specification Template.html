</p><h2><a name="SEC1" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
The following is an attempt to put together a complete, yet reasonably
flexible template for the specification of software designs. Wherever
possible, I have tried to provide guidelines (instead of prescribing
requirements) for the contents of various sections and subsections of
the document. Some may prefer to require more detailed subsections of a
particular section, choosing one or more of the subsection topics from
the list of guidelines provided. In this sense, this document is really
a template for a template.
</p><p>
In devising this template, I have gleaned information from many sources,
including various texts on Software Engineering (Pressman, Sommerville,
and Van Vliet), Object-Oriented Development (Booch, Rumbaugh, Berard,
and Wirfs-Brock), various SEI reports, DoD-Std and Mil-Std documentation
requirements (2167/2167A), and IEEE documentation standards
(particularly IEEE-1016 for software designs, and IEEE-830 for software
requirements).  I have made every effort <em>not</em> to assume or impose a
particular software development methodology or paradigm, and to place
more emphasis on content than on format.
</p><p>
It is my desire that a completed software design specification meet the
following criteria:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
It should be able to adequately serve as training material for new
project members, imparting to them enough information and
understanding about the project implementation, so that they are
able to understand what is being said in design meetings, and won't
feel as if they are drowning when they are first asked to create or
modify source code.
<p>
</p></li><li>
It should serve as "objective evidence" that the designers and/or
implementors are following through on their commitment to implement
the functionality described in the requirements specification.
<p>
</p></li><li>
It needs to be as detailed as possible, while at the same time not
imposing too much of a burden on the designers and/or implementors
that it becomes overly difficult to create or maintain.
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
Please note that there are no sections in this document for describing
administrative or business duties, or for proposing plans or schedules
for testing or development. The sections in this document are concerned
solely with the design of the software. While there are places in this
document where it is appropriate to discuss the effects of such plans on
the software design, it is this author's opinion that most of the
details concerning such plans belong in one or more separate documents.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h2><a name="SEC2" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC2">Document Outline</a></h2>
<p>
Here is the outline of the proposed template for software design
specifications. Please note that many parts of the document may be
extracted automatically from other sources and/or may be contained in
other, smaller documents. What follows is just one suggested outline
format to use when attempting to present the architecture and design of
the entire system as one single document. This by no means implies that
it literally is a single document (that would not be my personal
preference):
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> Introduction
</li><li> System Overview
</li><li> Design Considerations
<ul>
<li> Assumptions and Dependencies
</li><li> General Constraints
</li><li> Goals and Guidelines
</li><li> Development Methods
</li></ul>
</li><li> Architectural Strategies
<ul>
<li> <var>strategy-1 name or description</var>
</li><li> <var>strategy-2 name or description</var>
</li><li> ...
</li></ul>
</li><li> System Architecture
<ul>
<li> <var>component-1 name or description</var>
</li><li> <var>component-2 name or description</var>
</li><li> ...
</li></ul>
</li><li> Policies and Tactics
<ul>
<li> <var>policy/tactic-1 name or description</var>
</li><li> <var>policy/tactic-2 name or description</var>
</li><li> ...
</li></ul>
</li><li> Detailed System Design
<ul>
<li> <var>module-1 name or description</var>
</li><li> <var>module-2 name or description</var>
</li><li> ...
</li></ul>
</li><li> Glossary
</li><li> Bibliography
</li></ul>
<p>
The above outline is by no means exclusive.  A particular numbering
scheme is not necessarily required and you are <em>more</em> than welcome to
add your own sections or subsections where you feel they are
appropriate.  In particular you may wish to move the bibliography and
glossary to the beginning of the document instead of placing them at the
end.
</p><p>
The same template is intended to be used for both high-level design and
low-level design. The design document used for high-level design is a
"living document" in that it gradually evolves to include low-level
design details (although perhaps the "Detailed Design" section may not
yet be appropriate at the high-level design phase).
</p><p>
The ordering of the sections in this document attempts to correspond to
the order in which issues are addressed and in which decisions are made
during the actual design process.  Of course it is understood that
software designs frequently (and often fortunately) don't always proceed
in this order (or in any linear, or even predictable order).  However,
it is useful for the purpose of comprehending the design of the system
to present them as if they did. Frequently, one of the best ways to
document a project's design is to keep a detailed project journal, log,
or diary of issues as they are mulled over and bandied about and to
record the decisions made (and the reasons why) in the journal.
Unfortunately, the journal format is not usually organized the way most
people would like it for a formal review. In such cases, for the purpose
of review, the journal can be condensed and/or portions of it extracted
and reorganized according to this outline. However, if this is done then
you need to choose whether to update and maintain the design document in
the journal format, or the formal review format. It is not advisable to
try and maintain the design document in both formats. (If you have an
automated method of converting the journal into a formal document, then
this problem is solved.)

</p><h2><a name="SEC3" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC3">Document Description</a></h2>
<p>
Here is the description of the contents (by section and subsection) of
the proposed template for software design specifications:
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h3><a name="SEC4" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC4">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>
Provide an overview of the entire document:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Describe the purpose of this document
</li><li>
Describe the scope of this document
</li><li>
Describe this document's intended audience
</li><li>
Identify the system/product using any applicable names and/or version
numbers.
</li><li>
Provide references for any other pertinent documents such as:
<ul>
<li>
Related and/or companion documents
</li><li>
Prerequisite documents
</li><li>
Documents which provide background and/or context for this document
</li><li>
Documents that result from this document (e.g. a test plan or a
development plan)
</li></ul>
</li><li>
Define any important terms, acronyms, or abbreviations
</li><li>
Summarize (or give an abstract for) the contents of this document.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><dl compact="">
<dt><strong>Note:</strong>
</dt><dd>For the remaining sections of this document, it is conceivable (and
perhaps even desirable) that one or more of the section topics are
discussed in a separate design document within the project.  For
each section where such a document exists, a reference to the
appropriate design document is all that is necessary. All such
external (or fragmented) design documents should probably be
provided with this document at any design reviews.
</dd></dl>
<p>
</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h3><a name="SEC5" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC5">System Overview</a></h3>
<p>
Provide a general description of the software system including its
functionality and matters related to the overall system and its design
(perhaps including a discussion of the basic design approach or
organization).  Feel free to split this discussion up into subsections
(and subsubsections, etc ...).
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h3><a name="SEC6" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC6">Design Considerations</a></h3>
<p>
This section describes many of the issues which need to be addressed
or resolved before attempting to devise a complete design solution.
</p><p>
</p><h4><a name="SEC7" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC7">Assumptions and Dependencies</a></h4>
<p>
Describe any assumptions or dependencies regarding the software and its
use. These may concern such issues as:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Related software or hardware
</li><li>
Operating systems
</li><li>
End-user characteristics
</li><li>
Possible and/or probable changes in functionality
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><h4><a name="SEC8" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC8">General Constraints</a></h4>
<p>
Describe any global limitations or constraints that have a significant
impact on the design of the system's software (and describe the
associated impact). Such constraints may be imposed by any of the
following (the list is <em>not</em> exhaustive):
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Hardware or software environment
</li><li>
End-user environment
</li><li>
Availability or volatility of resources
</li><li>
Standards compliance
</li><li>
Interoperability requirements
</li><li>
Interface/protocol requirements
</li><li>
Data repository and distribution requirements
</li><li>
Security requirements (or other such regulations)
</li><li>
Memory and other capacity limitations
</li><li>
Performance requirements
</li><li>
Network communications
</li><li>
Verification and validation requirements (testing)
</li><li>
Other means of addressing quality goals
</li><li>
Other requirements described in the requirements specification
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><h4><a name="SEC9" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC9">Goals and Guidelines</a></h4>
<p>
Describe any goals, guidelines, principles, or priorities which dominate
or embody the design of the system's software. Such goals might be:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
The KISS principle ("Keep it simple stupid!")
</li><li>
Emphasis on speed versus memory use
</li><li>
working, looking, or "feeling" like an existing product
</li></ul>
<p>
For each such goal or guideline, unless it is implicitly obvious, describe
the reason for its desirability. Feel free to state and describe each goal
in its own subsubsection if you wish.
</p><p>
</p><h4><a name="SEC10" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC10">Development Methods</a></h4>
<p>
Briefly describe the method or approach used for this software design.
If one or more formal/published methods were adopted or adapted, then
include a reference to a more detailed description of these methods. If
several methods were seriously considered, then each such method should
be mentioned, along with a brief explanation of why all or part of it
was used or not used.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h3><a name="SEC11" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC11">Architectural Strategies</a></h3>
<p>
Describe any design decisions and/or strategies that affect the
overall organization of the system and its higher-level structures.
These strategies should provide insight into the key abstractions and
mechanisms used in the system architecture. Describe the reasoning
employed for each decision and/or strategy (possibly referring to
previously stated design goals and principles) and how any design
goals or priorities were balanced or traded-off. Such decisions might
concern (but are not limited to) things like the following:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Use of a particular type of product (programming language,
database, library, etc. ...)
</li><li>
Reuse of existing software components to implement various
parts/features of the system
</li><li>
Future plans for extending or enhancing the software
</li><li>
User interface paradigms (or system input and output models)
</li><li>
Hardware and/or software interface paradigms
</li><li>
Error detection and recovery
</li><li>
Memory management policies
</li><li>
External databases and/or data storage management and persistence
</li><li>
Distributed data or control over a network
</li><li>
Generalized approaches to control
</li><li>
Concurrency and synchronization
</li><li>
Communication mechanisms
</li><li>
Management of other resources
</li></ul>
<p>
Each significant strategy employed should probably be discussed in its
own subsection, or (if it is complex enough) in a separate design
document (with an appropriate reference here of course). Make sure that
when describing a design decision that you also discuss any other
significant alternatives that were considered, and your reasons for
rejecting them (as well as your reasons for accepting the alternative
you finally chose). Sometimes it may be most effective to employ the 
"pattern format" for describing a strategy.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h3><a name="SEC12" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC12">System Architecture</a></h3>
<p>
This section should provide a high-level overview of how the
functionality and responsibilities of the system were partitioned
and then assigned to subsystems or components. Don't go into too
much detail about the individual components themselves (there is a
subsequent section for detailed component descriptions). The main
purpose here is to gain a general understanding of how and why the
system was decomposed, and how the individual parts work together
to provide the desired functionality.
</p><p>
At the top-most level, describe the major responsibilities that the
software must undertake and the various roles that the system (or
portions of the system) must play. Describe how the system was broken
down into its components/subsystems (identifying each top-level
component/subsystem and the roles/responsibilities assigned to it).
Describe how the higher-level components collaborate with each other
in order to achieve the required results. Don't forget to provide some
sort of rationale for choosing this particular decomposition of the 
system (perhaps discussing other proposed decompositions and why they
were rejected). Feel free to make use of design patterns, either in
describing parts of the architecture (in pattern format), or for
referring to elements of the architecture that employ them.
</p><p>
If there are any diagrams, models, flowcharts, documented scenarios or
use-cases of the system behavior and/or structure, they may be included
here (unless you feel they are complex enough to merit being placed in
the <cite>Detailed System Design</cite> section).  Diagrams that describe a
particular component or subsystem should be included within the
particular subsection that describes that component or subsystem.
</p><p>
</p><dl compact="">
<dt><strong>Note:</strong>
</dt><dd>This section (and its subsections) really applies only to newly
developed (or yet-to-be developed) portions of the system. If there
are parts of the system that already existed before this development
effort began, then you only need to describe the pre-existing parts
that the new parts of the system depend upon, and only in enough
detail sufficient to describe the relationships and interactions
between the old parts and the new parts. Pre-existing parts that are
modified or enhanced need to be described only to the extent that is
necessary for the reader to gain a sufficient understanding of the
nature of the changes that were made.
</dd></dl>
<p>
</p><h4><a name="SEC13" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC13">Subsystem Architecture</a></h4>
<p>
If a particular component is one which merits a more detailed
discussion than what was presented in the <cite>System Architecture</cite>
section, provide that more detailed discussion in a subsection of the
<cite>System Architecture</cite> section (or it may even be more appropriate
to describe the component in its own design document). If necessary,
describe how the component was further divided into subcomponents, and
the relationships and interactions between the subcomponents (similar
to what was done for top-level components in the <cite>System
Architecture</cite> section).
</p><p>
If any subcomponents are also deemed to merit further discussion,
then describe them in a separate subsection of this section (and in 
a similar fashion). Proceed to go into as many levels/subsections of
discussion as needed in order for the reader to gain a high-level
understanding of the entire system or subsystem (but remember to leave
the gory details for the <cite>Detailed System Design</cite> section).
</p><p>
If this component is very large and/or complex, you may want to
consider documenting its design in a separate document and simply
including a reference to it in this section. If this is the option
you choose, the design document for this component should have an
organizational format that is very similar (if not identical to)
this document.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h3><a name="SEC14" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC14">Policies and Tactics</a></h3>
<p>
Describe any design policies and/or tactics that do not have sweeping 
architectural implications (meaning they would <em>not</em> significantly
affect the overall organization of the system and its high-level
structures), but which nonetheless affect the details of the interface
and/or implementation of various aspects of the system. Such decisions
might concern (but are not limited to) things like the following:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Choice of which specific product to use (compiler, interpreter,
database, library, etc. ...)
</li><li>
Engineering trade-offs
</li><li>
Coding guidelines and conventions
</li><li>
The protocol of one or more subsystems, modules, or subroutines
</li><li>
The choice of a particular algorithm or programming idiom (or design
pattern) to implement portions of the system's functionality
</li><li>
Plans for ensuring requirements traceability
</li><li>
Plans for testing the software
</li><li>
Plans for maintaining the software
</li><li>
Interfaces for end-users, software, hardware, and communications
</li><li>
Hierarchical organization of the source code into its physical
components (files and directories).
</li><li>
How to build and/or generate the system's deliverables (how to
compile, link, load, etc. ...)
</li></ul>
<p>
Each particular policy or set of tactics employed should probably be
discussed in its own subsection, or (if it is large or complex enough)
in a separate design document (with an appropriate reference here of
course). Make sure that when describing a design decision that you also
discuss any other significant alternatives that were considered, and
your reasons for rejecting them (as well as your reasons for accepting
the alternative you finally chose). For this reason, it may frequently
be convenient to use one of the more popular "pattern formats"
to describe a given tactic.
</p><p>
For this particular section, it may become difficult to decide whether
a particular policy or set of tactics should be discussed in this
section, or in the <cite>System Architecture</cite> section, or in the
<cite>Detailed System Design</cite> section for the appropriate component. You
will have to use your own "best" judgement to decide this. There will
usually be some global policies and tactics that should be discussed
here, but decisions about interfaces, algorithms, and/or data
structures might be more appropriately discussed in the same
(sub)section as its corresponding software component in one of these
other sections.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h3><a name="SEC15" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC15">Detailed System Design</a></h3>
<p>
Most components described in the <cite>System Architecture</cite> section will
require a more detailed discussion. Other lower-level components and
subcomponents may need to be described as well. Each subsection of this
section will refer to or contain a detailed description of a system
software component.  The discussion provided should cover the following
software component attributes:
</p><p>
</p><dl compact="">
<dt><em>Classification</em>
</dt><dd>The kind of component, such as a subsystem, module, class, package,
function, file, etc. ....
<p>
</p></dd><dt><em>Definition</em>
</dt><dd>The specific purpose and semantic meaning of the component. This
may need to refer back to the requirements specification.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><em>Responsibilities</em>
</dt><dd>The primary responsibilities and/or behavior of this component.
What does this component accomplish? What roles does it play?
What kinds of services does it provide to its clients? For some
components, this may need to refer back to the requirements
specification.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><em>Constraints</em>
</dt><dd>Any relevant assumptions, limitations, or constraints for this
component.  This should include constraints on timing, storage, or
component state, and might include rules for interacting with this
component (encompassing preconditions, postconditions, invariants, other
constraints on input or output values and local or global values, data
formats and data access, synchronization, exceptions, etc.)
<p>
</p></dd><dt><em>Composition</em>
</dt><dd>A description of the use and meaning of the subcomponents that are
a part of this component.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><em>Uses/Interactions</em>
</dt><dd>A description of this components collaborations with other components.
What other components is this entity used by? What other components
does this entity use (this would include any side-effects this entity
might have on other parts of the system)? This concerns the method of
interaction as well as the interaction itself. Object-oriented designs
should include a description of any known or anticipated subclasses,
superclasses, and metaclasses.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><em>Resources</em>
</dt><dd>A description of any and all resources that are managed, affected, or
needed by this entity. Resources are entities external to the design
such as memory, processors, printers, databases, or a software library.
This should include a discussion of any possible race conditions and/or
deadlock situations, and how they might be resolved.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><em>Processing</em>
</dt><dd>A description of precisely how this components goes about performing
the duties necessary to fulfill its responsibilities.  This should
encompass a description of any algorithms used; changes of state;
relevant time or space complexity; concurrency; methods of creation,
initialization, and cleanup; and handling of exceptional conditions.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><em>Interface/Exports</em>
</dt><dd>The set of services (resources, data, types, constants, subroutines,
and exceptions) that are provided by this component. The precise
definition or declaration of each such element should be present,
along with comments or annotations describing the meanings of
values, parameters, etc. .... For each service element described,
include (or provide a reference) in its discussion a description
of its important software component attributes (Classification,
Definition, Responsibilities, Constraints, Composition, Uses,
Resources, Processing, and Interface).
<p>
</p></dd></dl>
<p>
Much of the information that appears in this section is not necessarily
expected to be kept separate from the source code. In fact, much of the
information can be gleaned from the source itself (especially if it is
adequately commented). This section should not copy or reproduce
information that can be <em>easily</em> obtained from reading the source code
(this would be an unwanted and unnecessary duplication of effort and
would be very difficult to keep up-to-date). It is recommended that
most of this information be contained in the source (with appropriate
comments for each component, subsystem, module, and subroutine). Hence,
it is expected that this section will largely consist of references to
or excerpts of annotated diagrams and source code. Any referenced
diagrams or source code excerpts should be provided at any design
reviews.
</p><p>
</p><h4><a name="SEC16" href="http://www.bradapp.com/docs/sdd.html#TOC_SEC16">Detailed Subsystem Design</a></h4>
<p>
Provide a detailed description of this software component (or a reference
to such a description). Complex diagrams showing the details of component
structure, behavior, or information/control flow may be included in the
subsection devoted to that particular component (although, unless they are
very large or complex, some of these diagrams might be more appropriately
included in the <cite>System Architecture</cite> section. The description should
cover any applicable software component attributes (some of which may be
adequately described solely by a source code declaration or excerpt).
